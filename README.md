PASSWORD GENERATOR 

  This is a Password Generator Project built using pure Python, without any GUI libraries like Tkinter. It allows users to create strong, secure, and customizable    passwords with the flexibility to define length, quantity, and character types. The project demonstrates core Python concepts, including loops, conditionals,       string manipulation, user input, and randomization, making it an ideal learning project for beginners or entry-level developers.


KEY FEATURES:

•	Customizable Password Length: Users can choose any password length.

•	Generate Multiple Passwords: Create 1 or more passwords in a single run.

•	Character Diversity: Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

•	Password Strength Indicator: Evaluates password security level (Weak, Medium, Strong).

•	Beginner-Friendly Code: Clean structure, easy to read and modify.

•	No External Libraries: Uses only Python's built-in libraries (random, string).


HOW IT WORKS:

(1.) The user is prompted to enter:
•	Number of passwords to generate
•	Desired length of each password

(2.) The program uses Python's random and string modules to:
•	Randomly select characters from four categories: lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols
•	Shuffle and combine them into secure passwords

(3.) A simple *strength checker* analyzes the password based on length and character variety, labeling it as: Weak, Medium, Strong

(4.) The final output is displayed in the terminal for easy copy-paste.


TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Python 3.x: Core programming language     

Random: To generate random characters     

String: To access ASCII characters
